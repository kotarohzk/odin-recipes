# Odin Recipes

This is my very first _project_ of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) which involves the use of the following HTML elements and techniques:

- HTML boilerplate
- Heading tags
- Anchor tags (use of relative link in href attribute)
- Image tags (use of absolute link in src attribute)
- Ordered list, unordered list, and list item tags
