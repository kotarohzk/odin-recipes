    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="fit">
      Cheese ramen is actually a classic Korean comfort food. Just as the name
      suggests, it is basically instant noodles with a combination of cheese.
      Other than that, milk is sometimes used for the broth instead of the usual
      cup of hot water.
    </p>
    <p class="fit">
      Over time, this cheesy ingredient gradually seeped into Korean culinary
      history with new menu items emerging from its acceptance. Eventually,
      adding cheese became an indulgent way to enjoy a bowl of instant noodles,
      giving birth to the Korean spicy cheese ramen recipe!
